          <strong> Zine design project</strong>.
          <i>Stories About My Brother</i>, is a real story written by Prachi
          Gupta. After reading her story, I was deeply touched and decided to
          create a published version of it. The story is about love and miss of
          a sister to her young & talented brother who died very young because
          of blood clot. She tried to figure out what the last days of her
          brotherâ€™s life looked like and what caused her brother died at such a
          young age.
